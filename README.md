## Bots Compose - Agent Bot to redirect messages to specific Bots

Generally bots address queries related to a specific domain or topic. If a user wants to query for something from a different domain then the user will have to switch to a different bot and ask question. E.g. If I want to travel to a place, I might query for weather and also book a cab or flight. I might have to end up switching between two bots, weather bot and travel bot. What if I could just have one interface bot which will redirect my messages to a specific bot and get answers to me? Well, this code pattern showcases an implementation of this approach.

The solution here is to have an agent bot (or an interface bot) and a few other bots which can handle queries for a specific domain, let's call these specific bots. The agent bot knows about the specific bots and also about which domain each of them can handle. When user initiates conversation with agent bot, the agent bot will understand the intent of user query and it will redirect the user query to a specific bot. Subsequent requests from user are redirected to specific bot. When the conversation with the specific bot is over or when the specific bot is not able to handle the request, the control is given back to agent bot which will then redirect the messages to appropriate bot.

This approach provides and seamless experience for the user. It can be used by organisations which provide a host of services to its customers like financial services, tours and travel agencies, news agencies etc..

Advantages with this approach are:
- plug and play the bots
- Modular approach facilitates bots composition
- Come up with new services by composing two or more bots
- Easy to maintain, make changes, add/remove functionalities
- Easy to troubleshoot issues
- Transparent to user

In this code pattern we will use Watson assistant bot for building bots and Nodejs application as orchestration layer.

## Flow

![Architecture](images/architecture.png)

1. User accesses web application and types in a message. Nodejs application, an orchestration later, send user message to agent bot
2. Agent bot determines the intent of the message and responds with the specific bot details to which the message needs to be redirected.
3. Nodejs application sends message to the specific bot (Weather Bot, in this case). Specific bot responds. Conversation continues between user and specific bot.
4. When the conversation with specific bot is over, user message is then sent to agent bot to determine the intent
5. Nodejs application sends message to the specific bot (Travel Bot, in this case). Specific bot responds. Conversation continues between user and specific bot.

![AppHomePage](images/app_home_page.png)

- On command prompt monitor logs using the command
```
ibmcloud cf logs watson-assistant-multi-bot-agent
```

- On the application home page type a weather related query `What does the weather look like tomorrow?`.
![Query1](images/query_1.png)
- Check the log files and notice that the message first goes to Agent Bot and then it is redirected to the Weather Bot.
![AppLogs1](images/app_logs_1.png)
- In the interface, you are asked to enter the location. Enter a location, e.g. `Bengaluru`.
- Check the logs. Because the conversation with the Weather Bot has not ended, subsequent messages are sent to the Weather Bot itself, without the intervention of the Agent Bot.
![AppLogs2](images/app_logs_2.png)
- The Weather Bot responds with an answer to user query and hence conversation with Weather Bot is treated as ended.
- Next user enters a travel related query `Book a cab`.
- In the logs, notice that the message is sent to Agent Bot and then it is redirected to Travel Bot.
![AppLogs3](images/app_logs_3.png)
- In the interface you are asked to enter a date for cab booking. Enter a date or you can just say `Today`.
- Check the logs. Because the conversation with the Travel Bot has not ended, subsequent messages are sent to the Weather Bot itself, without the intervention of the Agent Bot.
![AppLogs4](images/app_logs_4.png)
- In the interface you are asked to enter time for the cab to arrive. Say `12 PM`.
- Check the logs. Travel Bot responds with an answer. The conversation with Travel Bot has ended.
- The above conversation flow can continue and the Agent Bot will redirect the messages to specific bots based on the intent of user query
- Some of the basic messages as greetings and bye can be handled by Agent Bot itself.
- In the interface type `Thank you. Bye`

![ChatInterfaceFull](images/chat_interface_full.png)
